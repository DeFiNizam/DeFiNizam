# 👋 Hi, I’m Nizam (@DeFiNizam)

I’m a **DeFi & WEB3 Technology Researcher** exploring how decentralized systems work in practice.
My focus is on understanding **protocols, security models, data flows, and on-chain behavior**, using tools, scripts, and AI where helpful — not as a full-time programmer, but as a researcher learning by doing.
 
I believe the best way to understand DeFi is to **follow the flow**:

**📜 Protocol → 📊 Data → 🧠 Behavior → 🛡️ Risk → 🚀 Opportunity**

---

## 🔍 What I Focus On 

### 🧠 DeFi & WEB3 Research

Studying protocols, token mechanics, incentives, and real-world usage.

### 🔐 Security & Risk Awareness

Researching scams, exploits, attack patterns, and defensive practices in DeFi.

### 📊 On-Chain & Off-Chain Analysis

Observing wallet behavior, transactions, and protocol activity to understand trends.

### 🤖 AI-Assisted Research

Using open-source AI tools to analyze information, summarize data, and explore patterns.

### 🌐 Open Knowledge & Experiments

Sharing research notes, tools, and experiments openly to learn in public.

## 🛠️ Tools I Use (Not a Programmer, Just Practical)

* **Scripting & Automation**: Python
* **AI Tools**: Open-source models
* **Workflow**: Git, GitHub, VS Code
* **Automation**: Bots, APIs, data collectors

**Domains I Explore:**

* DeFi protocols
* WEB3 security
* On-chain data
* AI + WEB3 research

---

## 🚀 Current Research Direction

* Learning DeFi by observing real protocol behavior
* Understanding how exploits and failures actually happen
* Exploring AI-assisted research workflows
* Building small research utilities, not full products
* Following the WEB3 & DeFi tech flow rather than hype cycles

---

## 🌱 Research Philosophy

* Observe first.
* Read the code.
* Follow the transactions.
* Learn from failures.
* Share what’s understood.

I don’t claim to be a developer or trader — I focus on **research, systems, and understanding**.
